DATASET

The dataset is "Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits". Each row contains 65 values. First 64 are input attributes in range [0,1] the last value is class code from 0 to 9.
The dataset is split into 3: train.txt (3100 instances), test.txt(1670 instances) and validation.txt(850 instances). The neural network training is done using train.txt, and the validation set is validation.txt. Accuracy of the network is tested using test.txt.

RESULTS

NOTE:
* The accuracy of the network was calculated by taking the average accuracy over 10 trials.
* In each trial, the number of hidden layer units was varied between 5-10 and the accuracy was calculated for each different size of the hidden layer.
* The number of training iterations for each hidden layer size and across trials - varies (max. 3000) because of the random initialization of the weight matrix.
